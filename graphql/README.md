# GraphQL Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with Golang** based on Prisma & [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git
```

Ensure dependencies are available and up-to-date:

```
cd prisma-examples/go/graphql
dep ensure -update
```

### 2. Install the Prisma CLI

To run the example, you need the Prisma CLI. Please install it via Homebrew or [using another method](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-cli-and-configuration/using-the-prisma-cli-alx4/#installation):

```
brew install prisma
brew tap
```

### 3. Set up database & deploy Prisma datamodel

For this example, you'll use a free _demo database_ (AWS Aurora) hosted in Prisma Cloud. To set up your database, run:

```
prisma deploy
```

Then, follow these steps in the interactive CLI wizard:

1. Select **Demo server**
1. **Authenticate** with Prisma Cloud in your browser (if necessary)
1. Back in your terminal, **confirm all suggested values**

 <summary>Alternative: Run Prisma locally via Docker</summary>

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition).
1. Create `docker-compose.yml` for MySQL (see [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/database-connector-POSTGRES-jgfr/) for Postgres):
    ```yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      prisma:
        image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.34
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "4466:4466"
        environment:
          PRISMA_CONFIG: |
            port: 4466
            databases:
              default:
                connector: mysql
                host: mysql
                port: 3306
                user: root
                password: prisma
                migrations: true
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
        volumes:
          - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
      mysql:
    ```
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Set the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` to `http://localhost:4466`
1. Run `prisma deploy`

</details>

You can now use [Prisma Admin](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-admin/overview-el3e/) to view and edit your data by appending `/_admin` to your Prisma endpoint.

### 4. Start the GraphQL server

```
go run ./server
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### 5. Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./src/schema.graphql`](./src/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(
    name: "Sarah"
    email: "sarah@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published 
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### 6. Changing the GraphQL schema

After you made changes to `schema.graphql`, you need to update the generated types in `./server/generated.go` and potentially also adjust the resolver implementations in `./server/resolver.go`:

```
go run scripts/gqlgen.go
```

This updates `./server/generated.go` to incorporate the schema changes in your Go type definitions. It also generates scaffolded resolvers in `tmp/resolver.go` that you might need to copy and paste into `./server/resolver.go`.
